#brackets-jslint-errors

A [Brackets](http://brackets.io) extension which helps you understanding errors produced by the most famous JavaScript linting tools.

>[JSLint](http://jslint.com) and the popular alternatives [JSHint](http://jshint.com) and [ESLint](http://eslint.org) are brilliant tools that make your code more consistent. But sometimes it's hard to understand exactly what they're asking you to change. JSLint goes so far as to be proud of the fact that it will "hurt your feelings".

>JSLint Error Explanations is designed to help you improve your JavaScript by understanding the sometimes cryptic error messages produced by JSLint, JSHint and ESLint, and teaching you how to avoid such errors.

## FAQ
###When I click on `?`, I get an *Explanation not found* error. Why?
That's probably because on [jslinterrors.com](http://jslinterrors.com) there isn't the error for which you are looking for help. However, if the explanation is there, please [file an issue](https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo/brackets-jslint-errors/issues/new).
